# Algoritmos y Programación 2

## Overview
This repository contains various projects and implementations for the "Algoritmos y Programación 2" course. Each project demonstrates different data structures and algorithms, implemented in Go and Python, covering key topics from the course curriculum.

## Projects

### Algogram
Algogram is a social media simulation application. It allows users to create and manage posts and users, simulating a basic social media platform.

See [Algogram README](algogram/README.md) for more details.

### Go Data Structures
This project includes implementations of various data structures in Go, such as binary search trees, dynamic stacks, graphs, hash tables, heaps, linked lists, and union-find structures.

See [Go Data Structures README](go-data-structures/README.md) for more details.

### ReRePolez
ReRePolez is a voting system simulation application. It includes modules for handling voter registration, party management, and vote processing.

See [ReRePolez README](rerepolez/README.md) for more details.

### VamosMoshi
VamosMoshi is designed to handle graph-based operations for various tasks such as finding routes, generating itineraries, and creating KML files for visualization.

See [VamosMoshi README](vamosmoshi/README.md) for more details.

### Python Graph Implementation
This project contains a Python implementation of a graph data structure along with various graph algorithms and a Union-Find data structure.

See [Python Graph Implementation README](graph-py/README.md) for more details.
